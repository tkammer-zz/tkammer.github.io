## Welcome to my blog

My name is Tal Kammer and I'm a software engineer.

It's been many years that I have played with the idea of writing a blog 
but always found some kind of excuse why it can't be "this weekend".
Thanks to my good friend [Arie Bregman](http://abregman.com/) who's been 
pushing me to start writing down my thoughts, I've decided that my new 
year's resolution will be to officially start my blog.

 
I will use this platform to write about different topics I hit
 during my years of development and product release.
 
 Since this is only the introduction post, I will not start diving into details yet but
 be sure to follow up on my next few posts.
 
 See you in my next post!
